## Inspiration

Many people do not know what to do with their lives, so we had to think of a solution.
We came up with the idea of a web application that helps users with their boredom,
making decisions, and thinking of ideas for their life.

## What it does

Provides the user with several options to do with their lives. Such AS:

- Using very entertaining websites to keep their minds occupied.
- Generating ideas using AI technology to help the user think of stuff to do.
- Organising these ideas and having the ability to add on notes about various ideas.
- Having AI to help with decision making, and being able to sort and generate Pros
  and Cons that come with each choice.
- cat.

## How we built it

We used typescript with react.js for the frontend website, and we also used python
with flask.py for the backend server. The AI generation for ideas and decision making
used the OpenAI api.
